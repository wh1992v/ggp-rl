Assessing the Potential of Classical Q-learning in General Game Playing

This is an exploration of Classical Q-learning in General Game Playing. Players are implemented based on classical Q-learning. One is an enhancement by using a dynamic epsilon strategy, the other is enhanced by combining online knowledge(Monte Carlo Search) to offline learning(Q-learning)

These players should be integreted to GGP_Base project to run, more information, please see https://github.com/ggp-org/ggp-base
